                    <h3>Challenges Facing Egypt</h3>
                    <p>
                        Egypt is currently grappling with numerous grand issues, including energy insecurity, increment in the reliance on fossil fuels, limited resources of renewable energy and increasing environmental pollution, 
                        altogether issues contribute to great challenge we aspire to solve, represented in Harvesting and storing energy from unconventional resources. In response to the challenge, this project offers a Magno Vertical 
                        Axis Wind Turbine (VAWT) as a clean energy solution. It was found that the wind a nonfunctional element presented in the nature can be employed to harness energy from renewable source. It’s abundant, sustainable, free, 
                        clean and can vary in speed. The wind movement only can’t produce energy. It was decided to be fused with electromagnetic induction which is observed in magnets and coils during changing the magnetic field. 
                        It’s simple mechanism that is efficient, reliable, and clean energy generation. If the Two techniques in collaboration results in simple effective green solution. The resulted outcomes of the prototype validated 
                        several promising aspects. The dual-generation system, which utilizes electromagnetic induction through two different methods, generated electrical outputs and valuable data

                    <h3>Project Idea</h3>
                    <p>
                        According to a 2015 study by Khammas et al., conventional power generation is expected to decrease due to environmental concerns, making wind energy a valuable alternative. Wind energy is abundant, low-cost, 
                        simple, scalable, eco-friendly, and allows control over output due to its variable speed. There are two main types of wind turbines: Vertical Axis Wind Turbines (VAWTs) and Horizontal Axis Wind Turbines (HAWTs). 
                        HAWTs are commonly used in large-scale farms, but VAWTs are smaller, more efficient, and do not need to face the wind. They can generate power directly and are increasingly supported by new technology.
                        VAWTs are mainly categorized into Savonius and Darrieus types. The Savonius turbine is more practical in the low wind due to its simplicity and self-starting ability, with efficiency up to 37%. Darrieus 
                        turbines have lower efficiency (below 10%) and low starting torture, which reduces their reliability. A notable example of Savonius turbines is in Akihabara, Tokyo (Fig. 2).
                        The proposed design is a Savonius VAWT with a dual electromagnetic generation system that converts rotor motion into electricity using magnets and copper coils. An Arduino-based monitoring system with sensors and 
                        screens tracks output. The generated electricity is stored in a lithium-ion battery. Since the generators produce AC while the battery needs DC, a bridge rectifier is used to convert AC to DC.
                        The prototype uses a combination of recycled, 3D-printed, and electronic components, supporting sustainability and cost-efficiency. It meets design requirements: compact 
                        and user-friendly, with real-time monitoring, environmentally friendly through using wind energy and recycled materials (e.g., copper wire, bicycle spokes, microwave motor), fast energy production due to dual-generation, 
                        safe and space-efficient, and low-cost and scalable using open-source components like Arduin.

                    <h3>Mathematical Laws</h3>
                    <p>
                        To better understand and analyze the performance of the Vertical Axis Wind  Turbine, several scientific laws and mathematical formulas were applied 
                        throughout the project. These equations  help in explaining the system efficiency, energy output, and its limits. From Betz’s
                        Law, which explains the maximum efficiency of wind energy conversion, to Faraday’s Law of Electromagnetic Induction and Magnetic Flux, where they 
                        explains how electrical energy is generated in both of our dual-generation systems. Additionally, calculations based on lithium-ion battery storage 
                        system provide an understanding of how electricality can be stored and used later. These laws form the backbone of the scientific analysis in our prototype.
                        Firstly, Betz’s law: It is widely known that wind turbines convert the kinetic energy of moving air particles into electrical energy by generating torque on 
                        the blades creating a lift force. Since kinetic energy depends on both the mass and velocity of an object and given that air retains measurable mass and volume 
                        the kinetic energy of wind can be calculated using the equation shown in 〖𝐟𝐢𝐠. (𝟗)〗^𝟔 . This equation demonstrates that higher air velocity 
                        leads to increased energy output. Similarly, air with greater mass has the ability to generate 
                        more energy. The equation for kinetic energy can be further developed into a power expression, 
                        as power is defined as energy per unit time. To make this transition, the mass of air is considered over 
                        time, which introduces the concept of mass flow – illustrated in 〖𝐟𝐢𝐠. (𝟏𝟎)〗^𝟔 – rate which is the amount 
                        of air mass passing through a given area each second. This leads to a formula where power 
                        depends not only on the air’s density and flow velocity, but also on the cross-sectional area 
                        swept by the turbine blades. By combining these factors, the well-known expression for wind 
                        power is derived shown at 〖𝐟𝐢𝐠. (𝟏𝟏)〗^𝟔, showing that the available power in the wind is directly proportional to the cube of the wind speed. This 
                        relationship forms the basis of Betz’s Law, which mathematically proves that no wind turbine can capture more than 59.3% of the kinetic energy in the 
                        wind, as extracting all the energy would reduce the wind speed to zero, causing air particles to accumulate downstream, which is physically 
                        impossible. The power extracted from the wind is directly proportional to the cube of the wind
                        velocity. When graphed illustrated at 〖𝐟𝐢𝐠. (𝟏𝟐)〗^𝟔, this relationship shows a steep, curved increase,
                        Hence a small rise in wind speed results in a much larger rise in power output. This illustrates
                        how crucial even slight improvements in wind velocity are to maximizing energy generation.

                        the total amount of magnetic field passing through a given surface area. It measures how much f the magnetic field lines go through that area. The more magnetic field lines that pass
                        through, the greater the magnetic flux. The equation of magnetic flux is shown at 〖𝐟𝐢𝐠. (𝟏𝟑)〗^𝟐 . Where the magnetic flux presented in the Greek
                        Letter Phi (𝜙) ,calculated as multiplying Magnetic Field  Strength (𝐵) by Area (𝐴) that filed penetrates and adjusting the
                        Angle theta (𝜃). After measuring of the magnetic filed strength of Neodymium Magnets (1.4 𝑇𝑒𝑠𝑙𝑎) and the area through which magnetic filed line pass through 
                        (5.02 ×10^(−3)  𝑚^2 )  and considering that the cosine of angle is already 1, then magnetic flux is calculated in Weber shown at 〖𝐟𝐢𝐠. (𝟏𝟒)〗^𝟐 . By
                        obtaining the magnetic flux, we can procedure Faraday’s Law of Electromagnetic Induction states that the magnitude of the electromotive force (EMF) that is generated is proportional
                         to the change of flux with respect to time shown at 〖𝐟𝐢𝐠. (𝟏𝟓)〗^𝟐. Where 𝐸𝑀𝐹 is the induced voltage, the negative sign reflects Lenz’s
                        Law meaning the induced 𝐸𝑀𝐹 opposes the change in magnetic flux. The  stands  to the number of turns in a coil. The 𝐸𝑀𝐹 produced can increase by
                        increasing the area that magnetic line passes though or acquire more stronger magnetic field . Another efficient way to generate 𝐸𝑀𝐹 and that is by rotating the loop of wire the 
                        phenomena occurs as the area of magnetic filed changes while rotating it. Therefore, we developed a rate of change of flux. Since the 𝐸𝑀𝐹 is not proportional to the flux with respect 
                        of time but to the change of flux with respect of time. Thus, when the flux is at the maximum
                        the flux isn’t changing at all. However, when flux is  at minimum or zero the rate of changeof flux is at maximum as result we got maximum
                        𝐸𝑀𝐹. This can be graphed at 〖𝐟𝐢𝐠. (𝟏𝟔)〗^𝟐. This law is fundamental to our capstone project, as both our upper and lower generators rely on rotating magnets on coils. As the magnets 
                        spin, the changing magnetic field induces voltage, enabling electricity generation from wind energy

                    <h3>Arduino System</h3>
                    <p>
                        The system is designed to collect real-time data using two high-precision sensors. The first is the ZMPT101B, a voltage transformer module known for its compact size and exceptional accuracy in AC 
                        voltage measurement. It operates based on a precision voltage transformer and conditioning circuit, making it ideal for non-intrusive voltage monitoring in low-power applications.
                        The second sensor is the ACS712, a fully integrated, Hall-effect-based linear current sensor. This sensor offers a broad current measurement range, typically ±5A, ±20A, or ±30A depending on 
                        the model, and is capable of accurately detecting both AC and DC currents. It features low noise output, fast response time, and high linearity, making it suitable for precise current sensing in real-time power monitoring systems.
                        Both sensors are configured to provide continuous feedback on the performance of the upper and lower generation units of the wind turbine system. These inputs are processed through an Arduino Uno 
                        microcontroller, which serves as the core of the data acquisition and control unit. The Arduino not only interprets analog signals from both sensors using its internal ADC (Analog-to-Digital Converter) but also controls a 16x2 LCD 
                        display for real-time visualization of voltage and current readings The integration of these components enables precise monitoring, control, and analysis of power generation performance. The circuit design, which includes voltage 
                        dividers, filtering capacitors, and isolation components to ensure measurement accuracy and electrical safety, is depicted in Fig. (7) and Fig. (8)This smart sensing and control setup not only enhances the accuracy and reliability 
                        of the system but also supports advanced diagnostics, fault detection, and optimization of energy output.

                    <h3>Negative & positive restults</h3>
                    <p>
                        Positive Results:  The lower industrial wasted generator produced a high voltage output, reaching a maximum of 183 V. The upper handmade (DIY) generator, delivered a significantly high current 
                        peaking at 120.4 mA. The maximum power output recorded was 1.159 W. The total energy output over five minutes was 327.54 joules, shows the successful of the dual generation mechanism. The use of 
                        Arduino monitoring systems ensured accuracy and real-time measurements. AC electric current can be utilized to operate AC circuit components like Light Bulb.
	                    Despite the success in achieving the core product, the project faced certain issues that should be addressed in future updates of the design. Negative Results: The current output of the lower generator was relatively
                        low (maximum 5.2 mA). The voltage output of the upper generator was insufficient (maximum 1.934 V). There was difficulty in synchronizing the outputs of the two systems due to different characteristics. Mechanical 
                        limitations in the prototype's structure, such as slight vibrations or instability at higher wind speeds, affected consistency.
                        Electric current is an AC current which make a problem when combining the output together.
	                    Although the negative results are not easily resolved, they can be addressed through advanced engineering approaches and further research. We noticed that the two generating system opposes each other in voltage and 
                        current. Upper one with significant low voltage and high current in contrast the lower one with significant high voltage and low current. Therefor, in response to this issue we opted for companying the two AC electric 
                        output of the dual mechanism together. Thereby A remarkable approach was chosen illustrated in using a Full Wave Diode Bridge Rectifier to convert the AC current to DC, circuit design is illustrated in 〖𝐟𝐢𝐠. (𝟔)〗^𝟒. It is mainly composed of:
                        Four diodes arranged in bridge configuration,
	                    converts positive-negative of AC to DC wave.
                        b)    Capacitor that acts a filter as it stores energy as
	                     voltage rises and release it when voltage drops.
                        c)    Resistor serve in controlling current flow.
	                    In this prototype, an Arduino-based monitoring system was added to accurately measure and display electrical parameters such as voltage and current
